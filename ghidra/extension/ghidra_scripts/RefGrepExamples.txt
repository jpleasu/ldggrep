Call paths starting at nodes named "entry" and ending at nodes matching /libc/
:  <"entry"> call* </libc/>

Call paths starting at main ending at nodes whose name contain "crt", case insensitive
:  <"main"> call* </(?i)crt/>

Call paths from main or entry ending in a function reference
:  </^(main|entry)$> call* ref <func>

Call paths from main or entry of length up to 3 that end in an import
:  </^(main|entry)$> call{,3} <imp>

Call paths from main or entry of length up to 3 that end in a reference to a string
:  </^(main|entry)$> call{,3} ref <str>
  
For each function that calls to a print function, find string references within 3 calls.
:  <func> <sto(0)> call </print/> ; <mem(0)> call{,3} ref <sto(0)> <str>
Note, the first expression stores functions that call to print in outgoing slot 0.
The second expression starts by matching those functions, now in incoming slot 0. Outgoing
slot 0 will contain the stored references to strings.
